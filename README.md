### Overview

This is an app created for EPSON Moverio BT-300 smart glasses to aid the visually impaired avoid collisions. The glasses are attached to a controller running on Androidâ„¢ 5.1. The device camera is used perform real-time object detection on the eyeglasses. The app uses **[TensorFlow Lite](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite)**, an open source deep learning framework for on device inference.

The red box in the middle of the screen indicates the line of sight of the visually impaired. 

The controller gives 3 types of vibrations to notify the user about the people in the surroundings. 
- Vibration A is a 500ms long buzz in the controller which indicates the presence of a person the line of sight of the user. 
- Vibration B conveys the absence of people in the frame(scene) by giving a 100ms vibration. 
- Vibration C, a 250ms buzz indicates the presence of a person in the frame (scene), but not in the line of sight to alert the user.

To create a positive user experience, every vibration is only given once after the detection. This is because if the controller keeps buzzing 24x7, it would prove to be annoying for the user.
